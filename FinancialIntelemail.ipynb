According to the CDC, fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws, rules and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. The CDC says people are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, such as the Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) or Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) vaccines, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) Janssen vaccine. At present, about 59% of American adults have received at least one shot, while 45% have received both. Here is how some major retail chains across the U.S. are responding: Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) said masks will no longer be required for fully vaccinated Walmart employees or customers starting from this coming Tuesday. Some local ordinances could still require masks. The company has also announced that a $75 bonus will be given to those employees who are or get vaccinated against COVID-19. Trader Joe's said fully vaccinated customers no longer need to wear masks in stores. However, it still requires its employees to wear masks. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) also said it is removing mask requirements for shoppers inside stores on Friday. But customers will still have to wear face masks in its pharmacy and optical departments. Retail chain Publix said it would no longer require masks for vaccinated people starting Saturday. Publix's stores are in seven states in the South, including Florida. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has not changed its rule regarding masks for shoppers and employees. Similarly, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) has not relaxed its rule regarding wearing masks. Home Depot Inc (NYSE: H.D.) has not changed its rules regarding wearing masks for its customers and workers. Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) and Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS) have said that they are still reviewing the CDC guidance.

The past week\\'s bullish calls included the iPhone maker and software and aerospace giants. Semiconductor and ride-sharing leaders were among the bearish calls seen during the week. The big U.S. indexes ended another volatile week in the red, led by a more than 2% retreat in the Nasdaq. The struggle between growth and value remains, as tech stocks continue to struggle. Inflation fears were boosted by higher than expected Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index figures, leaving investors to keep a close eye on what the Federal Reserve may do next. While the flow of earnings reports (which have been largely positive) began to slow, a reopening bellwether disappointed last week. Attention turns to the major retailers this coming week. The past week also saw a cyberattack with major consequences and the expansion of COVID-19 vaccine efforts, while the semiconductor shortage continues to hurt the auto industry and others. Also, it was another rollercoaster ride for cryptocurrency investors, and Securities and Exchange Commission rule changes could affect retail investors. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week\\'s most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. The Bulls Apple Inc.

Chris Katje\\'s \"Nike Just Does It: Analyst Likes Favorable Risk Reward, Shift From Wholesale To DTC\" discusses what has one Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) analyst growing increasingly confident. The Bears \"Intel Analyst Turns Bearish As Rival AMD Charges Forward\" by Shanthi Rexaline suggests that turnaround efforts under the new Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO do nothing to address continuing market share losses to its competitor.

Hon Hai reported $1 billion (NT$28.2 billion) in net income during the March quarter, beating the analyst consensus of NT$24.4 billion. It expects steady upcoming quarter guidance from growth in its consumer electronics and components divisions offset by a slowdown in its server and computer divisions partly due to the crisis. Chairman Young Liu reiterated the crisis persistence until Q2 2022 with a business impact of 10%. Last month, Liu had talked about the aggravation of the component scarcity since late March, with the lead time for some parts extending to 52 weeks. This month, Hon Hai agreed to set up a joint venture with Yageo Corp (OTC: YAGOY) to develop chips at an average selling price below $2. This JV will assist Hon Hai’s ongoing business transformation into semi/auto business to drive content value with margin expansion based on BofA analysts. The company’s robust Q1 and April sales reflect share gain in Apple business and the server market, the analysts stated. Hon Hai’s quarterly sales rose 44% to NT$1.35 trillion, at par with the analyst consensus from the robust demand for Apple’s new 5G devices and other consumer gadgets. Hon Hai estimates limited impact from the component and raw material price surge and aims to reach gross margins of 7% this year. Price action: HNHPF closed higher by 3.58% at $7.53 on Friday.

       " {'summary': '(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech is wading into a legal fight over visas to save the jobs of spouses of its foreign employees working in the U.S.Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google, Microsoft Corp. and more than 20 other companies and organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, on Friday urged a federal court in Washington to reject a lawsuit seeking to eliminate work authorization for more than 90,000 H-4 visa holders.Eliminating H-4 visas “would not only siphon off U.S. gross domestic product, but gift that productivity -- and the innovation that comes with it -- to other nations, harming America’s global economic competitiveness into the future,” the companies and organizations said in a brief the court can consider in weighing the case.Under the Obama-era “H-4 Rule,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2015 issued visas to spouses, more than 90% of whom are women, of more than 580,000 highly skilled workers who live in the U.S. on H-1B visas, according to the companies’ filing. The H-4 visa is critical to a couple’s decision to come to the U.S., buy a home and raise children, they argue. The Trump administration attempted to dismantle the rule but never introduced regulations to do so.Overseas TalentAbout three-quarters of H-1B holders work in the tech sector, which relies on the visas to hire overseas talent, particularly in science and engineering. Last June, then-president Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily freezing the issuance of new H-1B and H-4 visas. Twitter Inc. and Amazon last year called the order “short-sighted,” saying immigrant tech labor could help the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Representatives of Microsoft and Airbnb Inc. also spoke out, saying immigrants play a vital role in their companies’ success.Trump’s argument was that the visa programs allow employers to undercut native-born workers on wages. The companies say they need highly skilled workers to fill crucial jobs.Save Jobs USA, a group representing computer professionals at Southern California Edison who were replaced in 2015 by foreign workers in the U.S. on H-1B visas, sued to void the H-4 rule. The group argues DHS exceeded its authority when it issued it.“This case basically goes to the heart of our democracy and how our country is going to be governed,” John Miano, a lawyer for Save Jobs, said in an interview. “We have big corporations now going to the DHS to create guest worker programs, and they’ve discovered they can get things easier by bypassing Congress.”‘Government by Microsoft’The average U.S. citizen can’t call the DHS secretary, but the tech titans can throw a dinner party and schmooze the agency’s leaders to get what they want, Miano said. The tech companies decided to weigh in on the case because “they want to protect their investment,” he said. “Do we have government by Microsoft and Google, or do we have government by elected officials?”In a brief filed earlier this month, DHS under the Biden administration argued that Congress “delegated broad authority” to the agency, which includes “providing certain foreign nationals with temporary employment authorization.”A federal appeals court panel ruled in 2019 that Save Jobs had standing, or the legal right, to sue. The full D.C. court declined to reconsider the decision in January 2020, and the fight is now back in the lower district court, where the companies and groups filed their brief Friday.The case is Save Jobs USA v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 15-cv-00615, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).(Updates with background on Trump executive order and comment from Save Jobs USA.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
